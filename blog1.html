								<h2>Challenge #1: Thoughts on which Attributes to select for training</h2>
								<p>To select appropriate attributes that can provide the best results are key when building an AI-based security testing model.<br>
									<br>
									Two things, AI tool should be able to do both static analysis and dynamic analysis. Static analysis would involve a specific piece of code that is malicious in nature, leads to security vulnerabilities, some malware is present inside the code, etc. The AI tool should be able to comprehensively detect these things. While in dynamic analysis, the tasks are more challenging since the AI model should be able to detect events, patterns in the app, network, kernel, bridge, protocol behaviors to comprehensively detect vulnerabilities.<br>
									<br>
									I would use my step by step process. Analyzed what technologies do present AI-based tools use to effectively find vulnerabilities. Plan to use NLP Models(eg BERT, GPT), try pretrained models like Hugging Face's Transformers. Also use of Rule-Based Systems(that don't require Machine Learning) which can be easily integrated.<br>
									<br>
									I was able to research and come up with an idea, now my next challenge was "how to collect training data and which attributes should I consider?". 
									<br>
									My initial idea,<br>
									<code>
										General Information<br>
										{vulnerabilityName:""}<br>
										Behavioral Analysis<br>
										{reproductionSteps:""}<br>
										Anomaly Detection<br>
										{runtimeAnomalies:[{anomalyType:"", description:""}, {anomalyType:"", description:""}]}<br>
										Dynamic Code Analysis<br>
										{codeSnippet:"", affectedComponent:""}<br>
										Real-time Decision Making<br>
										{securityLevel:"", mitigationSteps:""}<br>
										#futurework#<br>
										{commonAttackVectors:["SQL Injection through input fields", "Authentication bypass using default credentials"]}<br>
									</code>
									<br>
									Later, I changed the initial idea and planned to consider numbers based on their privileges and ranks. However, some people suggested that it is not a good idea, instead, switch back to text-based attributes. <br>
									I understood that attributes should be text-based for better results. So now, should I consider text-based lines or some keywords which indicate what actions happened in the system?<br>
									Finally, I decided that for better results, I should consider text-based remediation and other attributes could be keywords that indicate some sort of event that happened on the system.<br>
									For each keyword, some kind of software program or automation should be written to know what the attribute refers to. Of course, some attributes could be common between activities that would show that some kind of relationship is there between attributes.<br>
									Most importantly, based on these attributes, the model should be able to understand what kind of event is running on the mobile app and decide what kind of testing should be done on these.<br>
									<br>
									While considering the practicality, I think the following model might give better results. It covers Identity/General Information, description(Which later would be processed with NLP. It covers behavioral traits, which contributes to the detectionMethods attribute. Affected components and severity that add up to the model and finally mitigationSteps and documentation would be really helpful.<br>

										{
  											"vulnerability": {
    											"name": "UnencryptedCommunication-CleartextTraffic",
    											"description": "Cleartext communication due to network_security_config misconfiguration or absence.",
    											"detectionMethods": [
      												{
        												"method": "NetworkTrafficAnalysis",
        												"description": "Analyze outgoing traffic for cleartext data patterns or insecure transmission."
      												},
      												{
        												"method": "CheckNetworkSecurityConfig",
        												"description": "Verify network_security_config presence, correctness, and encryption settings."
      												}
    											],
    											"affectedComponent": ["NetworkModule", "ApplicationConfiguration"],
    											"severity": "Critical",
    											"mitigationSteps": [
      												{
        												"step": "EnableCleartextTrafficSetting",
        												"description": "Activate secure transmission protocols to encrypt data."
      												},
      												{
        												"step": "ImplementSecureProtocols",
        												"description": "Employ robust encryption protocols (e.g., TLS) for data transfer."
      												},
      												{
        												"step": "PeriodicReviewNetworkConfig",
        												"description": "Regularly review and update network configuration to maintain security."
      												}
    											],
    											"documentation": {
      												"structured": false,
      												"text": "Detailed guide with practical steps for implementing secure transmission protocols."
    											}
  											}
										}
									</code>

									<br>
									<br>
									After some analysis I understood that for better results, definitely I have to consider few more attributes for the training data. <br>
