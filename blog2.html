								<h2>Tracking Our Progress</h2>
								I am thrilled to announce that within <b>1 month and 10days</b>, I have curated a substantial dataset of high-quality Android app vulnerabilities, totaling over <b>700 entries:)</b> <br>
								These vulnerabilities have been collected  and are <b>securely</b> stored in a cloud-based storage instance.<br>
								With 2 months and 20 days left based on my initial plan, I plan to collect a great dataset.<br>
								Well, I also plan to extend the dataset collection task to 1 more month extra.
								
								
						<h2>Challenge #2: Training Dataset and Quality Assurance</h2>
						
								Anyone who knows data science would agree with me that data collection is the most important and challenging part in the AI/ML project.<br>
								It is also important to consider and a collect dataset with <b>meaningful keywords, define those properly inside the system, which scenarios they could emerge, which components do they affect, serverity, linked vulnerabilities, code based analysis, malicious behaviours, behavioural analysis, reproduction steps, scripts and code snippets, vulnerability name, runtime anomolies, dynamic and static behaviours, text based description(unstructured documentation), keywords and their priorities, analysis on kernel, static, dynamic, runtime, rest and diffent levels, scoring, decision making and false positives detection</b>.<br> 
								I decided that I would spend months preparing for the dataset, worst case I would spend 25% of the planned project effort, but would not to compromise on the traing data.<br>
