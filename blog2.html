								<h2>Tracking Our Progress</h2>
								I am thrilled to announce that within <b>1 month and 10days</b>, I have curated a substantial dataset of high-quality Android app vulnerabilities, totaling over <b>550 entries:)</b> <br>
								These vulnerabilities have been collected  and are <b>securely</b> stored in a cloud-based storage instance.<br>
								With 2 months and 20 days left based on my initial plan, I think signaficantly good dataset.<br>
								Well, I also plan to extend the dataset collection task to 1 more month extra(total 5 months), since I understand the importance of training dataset.<br>
								
								
						<h2>Challenge #2: Training Dataset and Quality Assurance</h2>
								"Just as well-prepared soil yields bountiful harvests, so too does a well-prepared dataset lay the groundwork for success in machine learning."<br>
