									I understood that attributes should be text-based for better results. So now, should I consider text-based lines or some keywords which indicate what actions happened in the system?<br>
									Finally, I decided that for better results, I should consider text-based remediation and other attributes could be keywords that indicate some sort of event that happened on the system.<br>
									For each keyword, some kind of software program or automation should be written to know what the attribute refers to. Of course, some attributes could be common between activities that would show that some kind of relationship is there between attributes.<br>
									Most importantly, based on these attributes, the model should be able to understand what kind of event is running on the mobile app and decide what kind of testing should be done on these.<br>
									<br>
									While considering the practicality, I think the following model might give better results. It covers Identity/General Information, description(Which later would be processed with NLP. It covers behavioral traits, which contributes to the detectionMethods attribute. Affected components and severity that add up to the model and finally mitigationSteps and documentation would be really helpful.<br>
